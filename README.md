# Google Hash Code 2020

This code, fully done during Google's 2020 Hash Code competition, tries to solve this year's problem.

The main objective was to obtain the highest score by scanning different books that were distributed over different libraries in a limited number of days. Copies of the same book could be available in more than one library. Each book was assigned a score, and points could only obtained once per book (i.e. scanning two copies of the same books will only award points once). Moreover, each library had a certain “signup” time (start-up/initiation time) and a different throughput (number of books that can be scanned per day). Only one library can be performing the signup process at each time instance, while scanning of books can be done in parallel.
